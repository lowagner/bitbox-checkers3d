### controls

Use L/R to choose the piece you want to move, use A/B/X/Y to choose the spot to jump to, 
and press start to finally move the piece.  Use d-pad to move the view around.



### TODO

Haven't yet coded in extra hops when you hop over an enemy, you get to go again (if you
are going to hop another enemy with that piece).
