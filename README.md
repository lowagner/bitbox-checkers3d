a 3d checkers game

### Controls

Use L/R to choose the piece you want to move, use A/B/X/Y to choose the spot to jump to, 
and press start to finally move the piece.  

Use d-pad to move the view around.  Press select to reset the view.

To reset the game, press L+R+start all at the same time.


### TODO

* Haven't yet coded in extra hops when you hop over an enemy, you get to go again (if you
are going to hop another enemy with that piece).

* Needs some nice ambient space music.
